## Comprehensive Machine Learning Fundamentals with Jupyter Notebooks

### Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms 
that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.

This repository provides an introduction to the basics of machine learning through three Jupyter notebooks:
**1. Machine Learning:** In this notebook, the basic principles of machine learning are explained and it provides you with a relative familiarity with machine learning topics.
**2. Regression:** The regression notebook is related to 3 regressions: simple linear regression, multiple linear regression andpolynomial regression,
for each of which a simple example is given.
**3. Supervised-Algorithms:** In this notebook, you can see examples for 5 of the supervised algorithms and be relatively familiar with their definitions.

These notebooks are designed to be comprehensive and self-contained, providing a solid foundation for anyone interested in learning data science. Each notebook includes:

**Clear explanations:** Concepts are explained in a clear and concise manner, making them accessible to beginners.
**Code examples:** Each concept is accompanied by practical code examples that you can run directly in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
**Interactive exercises:** The notebooks include interactive exercises to test your understanding and solidify your learning.
**Visualization:** Data visualizations are used throughout to enhance understanding and provide insights.

### **Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:** Use `git clone https://github.com/Hivayrn/Machine-Learning` to clone the repository locally.
2. **Install dependencies:** Each notebook may have specific dependencies. Refer to the individual notebooks for instructions on installing required libraries.
3. **Open the notebooks in Jupyter:** Use `jupyter notebook` to launch the Jupyter Notebook environment and open the desired notebook file.
4. **Run the code cells:** Execute the code cells within each notebook to follow along with the examples and exercises.
